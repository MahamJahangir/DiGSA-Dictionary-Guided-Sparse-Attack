# DiGSA-Dictionary-Guided-Sparse-Attack
DiGSA (Dictionary-Guided Sparse Attack) generates sparse, low-ℓ₂ adversarial examples using feature maps and dictionary learning. It creates fast, one-shot perturbations that highlight key image regions, achieving competitive results with reduced computation and strong resistance against defense strategies.
